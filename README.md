2. Choose one of the following options:
   a. Download the zip file (click on "Download ZIP").
   b. If you have Git installed on your machine:
      - Copy the HTTPS link.
      - Open your terminal (bash for Linux or cmd for Windows).
      - Use the following command to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RishabhSingh4872962/Mern-Assingnment.git
```


## Set Up Backend and Frontend

1. Open the downloaded or cloned repository folder.
2. Inside the folder, you will find two subfolders: `backend` and `mern-frontend`.

### Backend Setup

1. Create a `.env` file inside the `backend` folder.
2. Add the following environment variables to the `.env` file and save it:
```bash
PORT=5000
JWTSECRET="#I@Am%Good&&MERNStack&Developer()OneDay&Hope@I@DO$IT+Well"
```

4. Open a terminal in your code editor IDE and navigate to the `backend` folder.
`
Open Visual Studio Code (VS Code) on your machine.

Once VS Code is open, navigate to the top menu bar.

Click on "View" in the menu bar to expand the "View" dropdown menu.

From the "View" dropdown menu, select "Terminal" (or simply press Ctrl + ).

A terminal will appear at the bottom of the VS Code window, allowing you to run commands and interact with your project's folders and files through the command line.

You can also use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + to quickly open the terminal.

With the terminal open, you can navigate to your project folders, run scripts, install dependencies, and perform other command-line tasks related to your project.

Note: The exact steps and keyboard shortcuts may vary slightly based on your operating system.

6. Run the following commands in the terminal:
```bash
npm install
node app.js
```


### Frontend Setup

1. Open another terminal in your code editor IDE.
2. Navigate to the `mern-frontend` folder.
3. Run the following commands in the terminal:
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Now, you have both the backend and frontend servers running. The backend server runs on port 5000, and the frontend server runs on a different port.

Feel free to explore the MERN application you set up! If you encounter any issues, please refer to the error messages in the terminals or the code comments for troubleshooting.

Happy coding!
